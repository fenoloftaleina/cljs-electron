# Digi
Digi is a tiny electron app made for my little boy to play with. It is built upon https://github.com/Gonzih/cljs-electron. Sounds synthesised with https://github.com/keithwhor/audiosynth.

## How to run it?

From the cljs-electron readme:

```shell
npm install electron -g # install electron binaries

lein cooper                      # compile cljs and start figwheel
electron .                       # start electron from another terminal
```
